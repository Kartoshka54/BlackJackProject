# BlackJackProject
Hello! This is our small JAVA project for our University
It's being made by me and my project buddy to display our understanding of JAVA and certain data structures that are being used in this project.
A Blackjack game has many logical components that need to be implemented so we decided to tackle this task and tried to create our own little game.
Currently the project is still work in progress and is planned to be a console application. We may decide to add a GUI later.
We also may add our own little twist to the game so it becomes a little bit more interesting but thats up to the future.
We want to thank the visitors that may be interested in this game, and I hope you enjoy our concept :)!


How to play:
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer ( you can check this by opening your CMD or Terminal and typing in "Java -version")


2. Go to the file directory where you hava saved the files, go to BlackJack Project --> BlackJack --> src


3. Press ALT + D in the src file path and type in CMD, when the CMD opens then type "java BlackJackGame" 


4. Congrats! Now the game should be running with the implemented soundtrack. Have fun playing :)!
